                    <p>A mortgage is a loan specifically designed for purchasing real estate. When you take out a mortgage, you borrow money from a lender (like Light Bank) to buy a home, and in return, you agree to repay the loan over a specified period, typically ranging from 15 to 30 years. Mortgages usually come with lower interest rates compared to other types of loans, making them an accessible way to finance your property.</p>
